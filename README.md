### Project Proposal:
Our project addresses the important problem of understanding customer feedback for businesses. Customer feedback is essential for business growth. It helps businesses to understand customer needs, highlight shortcomings in their products and allow them to address these issues.

As a solution for this, our project will be gathering customer reviews and analyzing them to provide insights to the product owners. We will use Web Scraping techniques to gather customer feedback from various online sources. Then, the AI module of our project will analyze the data using natural language processing techniques, produce an overall score and determine the specific features that are most liked or criticized by the customers. Following this, we will design a dashboard for the product owners where they can see the insights in a user friendly manner. Ultimately, our project will be helping businesses to make data-driven decisions that goes hand to hand with the needs of their target audiences.
